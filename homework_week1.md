# Understanding for SQA #

----------


In my opinion, SQA is a process that taken in the software life cycle to make sure the software would meet the quality expectation with some stantards, steps and practices. It covers almost every phases in sofware life cycle, from planning, designing, realization and testing.

I thought SQA meant testing, now I know that it covers more bthan testing, we should figure out the final quality stantards at the beginning and set down some rules to be followed. In this way, we can more likely to reduce the bug or error and assure the quality of software.

When we talk about how to do SQA, we need SQE to do this quality assurance in engineering way. We have to know what is good and how to measure it in a mensurable way.Besides we have some public standards such as ISO9001. It can help enterprice to do SQA.
