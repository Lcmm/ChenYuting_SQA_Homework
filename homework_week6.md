#Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives #


**Testing vs. preventive actions**

- Different applicability to maintenance
- Objects QA activities applied on different things:
    
    executable code vs dev. activities
- Different development phases: 
  
    testing phase and later vs defect prevention on (req/spec/design/coding)
- General expertise levels:

    low vs high
- Problem or defect types:

     dynamic failures & related faults VS. negating causes or pre-conditions to pervasive problems

**Testing vs. formal verification**

- tesing is important link in dev. process
- defect situations:

    Medium/low vs  Low/no
- Cost:

    moderate vs hight
- Different development phases

**testing vs. Inspection**

- Existence of the implemented product
- Levels of quality/defects
- Static vs. dynamic defects
- Localized vs. interconnected defects
- Combined approaches
- phases and transitions
- inspection of testing entities/processes

**testing vs. fault tolerance**

- Problem or defect types:

    Dynamic/run-time/interaction problems vs Dynamic problems (must be rare)

- General expertise levels:

    low - high vs high , need specific background knowledge- Dynamic system
- applied on specific objects
    
    executable code vs operational software system
