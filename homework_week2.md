#Summary of the content of week 2#

In chaper4, we get QA in content, we get to know that defect handling is an integral part of QA activities, and different QA alternatives and related activities can be viewed as a concerted effort to ensure software quality. 
These activities can be integrated into software development and maintenance processes as an integral part of the overall process activities,These QA activities can also be partitioned into verification  and validation activities  using a bi-partite classification scheme in the so-called V&V view.  Similarly, they can be partitioned by the generic way they employ to deal with errors, faults, or failures as different defect-centered activities using our tri-partite classification scheme in the so-call DC view. Both views and both classification schemes have their useful purposes and implications.

In chapter5, we know what is QA and what is SQE, then we get SQE process. from all chapter we know that to manage the quality assurance activities and to provide realistic opportunities of quantifiable quality improvement, we need to go beyond QA to perform the following:

1. Qualityplanning before specific QA activities are carried out, in the so-called pre-QA activities in software quality engineering. 
2. Qualily quantijkation and improvement through measurement, analysis, feedback, 
and follow-up activities.  

We can integrate all these QA activities  into the overall software development and maintenance process.Following this general framework and with  a detailed description of  pre-QA quality planning in  this chapter, we can  start our 
examination of the specific QA techniques and post-QA activities in the rest of this book.

In chapter 6, we know basic concepts of testing and examined various questions and issues related to testing.  In addition,  we classified the major testing techniques by  two important criteria:  

1. Functional  vs.  structural  testing techniques
2. Usage-based vs.  coverage-based stopping criteria and corresponding testing tech- niques
